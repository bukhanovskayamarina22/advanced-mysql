--TASKS

-- Task 1

-- Lucky Shrub need data on client orders. They have written the following SELECT query to retrieve all data from the Orders table:

-- SELECT * FROM Orders;

-- However, the data they need is contained within the OrderID, ProductID, Quantity and Date columns. So, these are the important fields that their query must target. Targeting other columns in the table is an inefficient use of resources.

-- Rewrite the SELECT statement so that it is optimized.

SELECT OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, Date FROM Orders;

-- Task 2

-- Lucky Shrub need to find the order placed by the client Cl1. They have written the following query to complete this task:

-- SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE ClientID = 'Cl1';

-- However, this query's execution plan shows that it does not use an index to perform this search, as indicated by the NULL values in possible_keys and keys columns.  

-- Help Lucky Shrub to optimize this query by creating an index named IdxClientID on the required column of the Orders table. Once you have created the index, run the same SELECT statement as above with the EXPLAIN statement.

CREATE INDEX Orders_ClientID_IDX ON Orders (ClientID VARCHAR(10));

-- Task 3

-- Lucky Shrub have written the following SELECT query to find the details of the employee whose last name is 'Tolo'

-- SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE FullName LIKE '%Tolo';

-- However, there’s an index on the FullName column which the query cannot use because it contains a leading wildcard (%) in the WHERE clause condition.

-- The following steps can be taken to eliminate the leading wildcard:

-- Step 1: Add a new column to the Employees table called ReverseFullName.

-- Step 2: Populate the ReverseFullName column with the name of each employee as its values, but in reverse.

-- Step 3: Finally, create an index named IdxReverseFullName on the ReverseFullName column.

-- Follow these steps first and then rewrite the SELECT query and improve its performance so that it uses a trailing wildcard instead of the leading wild card.

ALTER TABLE Employees ADD COLUMN ReverseFullName VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT NULL;

CREATE TABLE ReverseNamesTemp AS (SELECT EmployeeID, CONCAT (RIGHT(FullName, LENGTH(FullName) - LOCATE(' ', FullName)),
' ',
LEFT(FullName, LOCATE(' ', FullName) - 1)) AS reverse_name
FROM Employees);

UPDATE Employees e SET e.ReverseFullName = (SELECT t.reverse_name FROM ReverseNamesTemp t WHERE e.EmployeeID = t.EmployeeID);

SELECT ReverseFullName FROM Employees;

DROP TABLE ReverseNamesTemp;

CREATE INDEX IdxReverseFullName ON Employees (ReverseFullName);
